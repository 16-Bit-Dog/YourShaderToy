DO: DepthStencilObjects - DepthObject check, and ENUM inside Renderable

ADD dynamic depth test...

add dynamic blend state like enum prob?

THEN DOCUMENT AND COMMENT AND MAKE CODE FULLY CLEAN AND EXPLAINED

depthStencilStateDesc.StencilEnable = 0; //for now don't want it TODO: add stencil enable for faces properly later
        
default bind model textures --- since always same --- only need 1. also allow setting tex SRV inside Pipeline settings

add depth test and 3 face render styles

TODO: add state tracking and optimization to such like shader in use, raster func being used, ect.

add how much you shift option

add depth test stuff option and blend state

add matrix constant

finish adding camrea --- also default and not default setup for const buffer reserve

TODO NEXT: make default working vertex and pixel shaders

TODO: Add Matrix type for constant <-- and make it easy to setup

add MVP matrix and camrea controls for seperate loading and scene view (embedded in globals, and force takes constant 0 spot)
