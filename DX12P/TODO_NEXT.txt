in M3DR draw:

object: name

HasTex's (put a toggle for all 8)
    shows each 8 with texture info
    
SHOW button:
    double click allows breaking down M3DR into small renderer window DX11?

show width and height and stats of deccer object somehow in model view -make it for all object types as well
test

make dll #define toggle loader

default data crashes


//TODO: use ambient factor

fill MatData in 3DCommon, and set Mat size inside DX113D
pass const buffer to mat dat to shader thing, 1 const buf per model

make material preview and editor

make toggle: "use vertex colors" bool

add a get tex to check if I can show it

stream line the addition of d3d12 stuff

(draw all resources in a big node --> which all are in a smaller node same for pipeline ?)

TODO: add more noise parameters

TODO: test shader with noise

TODO:
- stream option to link mpeg-dash video of shader code live
- multi user program-ing on same shader <-- do after project file thing (add object copies to [proj dir which must be chosen before starting project - if proj format exists it runs that and loads, if not then does not load anything])

TODO: maybe adapt some stuff to node system?

add file saver PROJ file to save what you made

TODO: proof read for proper COM deletion so I stop leaking random mem- prob also make the non com thing a com and use .addressOf() instead of &

make all selectable text tabs green
^^ do always



--------

print out RTV size in FILE_MANAGER

add: check box and select,

^^ add "auto map block size to current RTV size" which just does math on the spot to auto set  

add "new DepthTexture" to file manager tab -- you have inside this tab 1 forced main depth, and you can make more--> maybe not?


make: Load TXT button

add matrix type constant

add VR mode 

add d3d12

view port in scene view always has acsess to w a s d cam, and thats what the cam is for - add debug selection and stuff
    - 

- add dynamic linking for shared class linkage for faster code 

add matrix constant


then code crawl or the TODOs I left in the code

add static model data:
- full screen tri
- full screen quad
