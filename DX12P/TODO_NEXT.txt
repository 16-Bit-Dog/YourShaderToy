bind all RTV and DEPTH with UAV after unbind OM every right before compute pass --> then clear the UAV to allow RTV and DPH to work later in code

ALSO ALSO --> create textures for DEPTH and RTV

Add imGUI indentation

TODO: proof read for proper COM deletion so I stop leaking random mem- prob also make the non com thing a com and use .addressOf() instead of &

make sure to resize all and set all dst and rtv when resizing screen, also remove garbage depth stencil and RTV once done this.


make register changer/swapper functionality 


TODO:
recreate RTV's if wrong size when compiling (only for new) and resize all buffers manually if resized manually

pipelineObj link is sent to a pipelineIntermediate to not allow easy dynamic change

set in ToRun before everything the OM render target, since that is when it runs. it runs this change even if compute only and compute is off

TODO: do same for depth stencil view


--------

test compute and binding

print out RTV size in FILE_MANAGER

add: check box and select,
 Texture-> COPY-TO-RTV 
 RTX -> COPY-TO-TEXTURE 

^^ add "auto map block size to current RTV size" which just does math on the spot to auto set  

add "new DepthTexture" to file manager tab -- you have inside this tab 1 forced main depth, and you can make more--> maybe not?


make: Load TXT button

add matrix type constant

add VR mode 

add d3d12

view port in scene view always has acsess to w a s d cam, and thats what the cam is for - add debug selection and stuff
    - 

- add dynamic linking for shared class linkage for faster code 

add matrix constant


then code crawl or the TODOs I left in the code

add static model data:
- full screen tri
- full screen quad
